        <h1>Business Case Background:</h1>

        Gabriel and David are 16-year-old boys who go to school together and on the weekends wash
        cars for extra money. They are both hardworking and ambitious young men. While their friends
        spend their weekends playing football or computer games, Gabriel and David are very focussed
        on their goal, to buy a car when they get their driver’s license - when they turn 18. Their small
        business began when their parents paid them to wash their cars. They studied car washing
        techniques and watched lots of YouTube videos to figure out the best way to clean the cars inside
        and outside. They decided to ask family if they would also like their cars washed, for a price of
        course! Friends of their family and their friend’s parents also started asking the boys to wash
        cars. They visit their customers houses to wash the cars, which the customers find suitable. Their
        business continued to grow due to word of mouth. They are reliable, thorough and meticulous
        and have gained a good reputation. They invested on a standing board with their business name
        and phone number which they place on the footpath when they are washing the cars. This has
        been a cheap and effective way of advertising their services and has led to new customers who
        live in the street of existing customers or new customers who are driving past while they are
        working and notice the sign. Their customers are generally in a 5km radius of their houses. This
        is quite convenient as they do not want to travel far to work, they either bike or take public
        transport to their customer’s homes. They would rather spend time earning money, then travelling
        between customer’s houses so they are only looking to find clients close to their houses. They
        have a vacuum cleaner pack that sits on their back like a backpack and another backpack with
        cleaning supplies. They use electricity and water at their client’s homes and as such their business
        running costs are low.
